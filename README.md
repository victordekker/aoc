# Advent of Code puzzle solutions

This project are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

The code base uses the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/).

## Solutions to the puzzles

You can find my solutions to the different problems under ``App\Console\Commands``. 

To run these solutions, use the commands (like `php artisan aoc2020:d1p1 input.txt`). 

Please do not use these published solutions to cheat at these puzzles. 
It is much more satisfying to create your own solutions! 
After you have, you can check my solution to compare and (perhaps) learn about other ways to get to the answer.
